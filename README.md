# Diffusion-Aesthetics-for-Images

This is an implementation of a algorithm which simulates diffusion-reaction to produce an aesthetic for graphics imagery, described as sets of points defining the exterior. The graphical primitives here in this image of the U.S. are squares:

Changing the pixelDensity to a value other than 1 results in the image being stretched repeated along the canvas on axes of different angles:

To get that little glitch effect I just left some images out of the sequence when I made the frames in a video.
